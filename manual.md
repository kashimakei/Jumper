## How to Play

The objective of the Platformer Game is to control the main character and make it jump from one platform to another, aiming to reach higher levels. Here are the controls:

- Use the **Space** key to make the main character jump.

- The main character will automatically move upward, and you need to time your jumps to land on the platforms.

- Be careful not to miss a platform or fall off the screen, as it will result in game over.

- As you progress through the levels, the platforms will become higher and the game's theme will change every ten levels.

- The game ends when you reach level 100 or lose by falling off the screen.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or running the Platformer Game, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Make sure you have installed Python and the required dependencies correctly.

2. Check that your Python version is compatible with the game. The Platformer Game is developed using Python 3.

3. Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for running the game. The game requires a screen resolution of at least 800x600 pixels.

4. If you are using a virtual environment, double-check that it is activated before running the game.
